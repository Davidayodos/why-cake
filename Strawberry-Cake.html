    <ol>
        <li>Preheat Your Oven: Preheat to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 8-inch round cake pans.</li>
        <li>Mix Dry Ingredients: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li>Cream Butter and Sugar: In a large bowl, beat the butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Mix in the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients: Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, alternating with the buttermilk and strawberry puree. Begin and end with the dry ingredients, mixing until just combined.</li>
        <li>Bake: Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then turn them out onto wire racks to cool completely</li>
        <li>Layer the Cakes: Place one cake layer on a serving plate. Spread a layer of frosting on top. Place the second cake layer on top and frost the top and sides of the cake.

            Decorate: Garnish with fresh strawberries.</li>
